## Documentation Organization

This Documentation consists of two parts: the [Usage Documentation]() and [Contribution Documentation]().

The [Usage Documentation]() contains thorough documentation for the usage of HarTex as well as comprehensive
documentation for the Configuration DSL.

The [Contribution Documentation]() contains in-depth documentation for the inner-workings of HarTex and its
internal architecture as resources for contributors to get started relatively easier.
