        ## Issue Guidelines

        - Search through [the existing IBEs](https://github.com/HT-Studios/HarTex-rust-discord-bot/labels/Bot%3A%20IBE) first to ensure that the IBE has not been previously reported;
        - Use a descriptive title. Avoid over-generic or vague wordings; and
        - Provide as much details as possible for easier debugging and tracking down of the issue. Screenshots, screen recordings, links or any material relating to the IBE may be included at your discretion, but is recommended.
