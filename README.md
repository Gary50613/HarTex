**HarTex is the spped-of-thought server management bot for Discord; built to be stable, flexible and customizable.**

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use HarTex is by using the publicly hosted instance of it. As of now, HarTex is currently only for
internal use as it is under heavy development. We will keep the usage of HarTex internal as we go through the development
stages, further announcements will be made when we open the bot up for public usage.

## Self-hosting

If you are interested in using HarTex at an early stage, then you may host your own instance of HarTex. Documentation for
which will be added at a later date.
