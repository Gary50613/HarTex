# HarTex-rust-discord-bot

HarTex is a Discord Bot primarily for moderation and administration. It is built to be stable, flexible and customizable.

This repository is solely for the transparency for the bot, as well as people who want to look at the inner workings of the bot.

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome and will be reviewed by the Developer Team.

## Self-Hosting

It is not recommended to self-host this bot. But if you really want to, you need to comply with the following requirements:

- Use the same license as the main repository is using: Apache-2.0;
- Your self-hosted instance of the bot must not use the same avatar and the name of the bot; and
- Support shall not be provided for the setup of the bot environment - the databases required, the language compiler required, etc.

Made with :heart:, using [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
